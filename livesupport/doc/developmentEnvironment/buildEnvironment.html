<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes the build environment for components of the
LiveSupport project.<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
As seen in the <a href="directoryStructure.html">directory structure</a>
description, each component is contained in its own directory, and has
the same general directory layout, which includes a Makefile on the top
of the directory. All components are build by <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/make.html">GNU make</a> working on
that Makefile. This document describes the targets for that Makefile.<br>
<br>
Parts of this document is inspired by the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html">GNU Coding Standards</a>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_50.html">Makefile
Conventions Standard targets</a>.<br>
<h2>Make targets<br>
</h2>
The following make targets are required for all components to support:<br>
<ul>
  <li>all</li>
  <li>clean</li>
  <li>depclean</li>
  <li>doc<br>
  </li>
  <li>dist</li>
  <li>check</li>
</ul>
<h4>all</h4>
Compile all source files for this component.&nbsp; As a result, the
component is ready to be run (if an executable) or linked to (if a
library).<br>
This target traverses the dependent modules, and executes the all
target on them, if their targets do not exist.<br>
<h4>clean</h4>
Delete all files generated by the all target, but only for this module
(e..g. no files for dependent modules are deleted).<br>
<h4>depclean</h4>
Delete all the dependent target files. Executing the depclean target
with an all target afterwards results in a full recompilation of all
the dependent modules.<br>
<h4>doc</h4>
Generate the documentation for this component. This would include
processing info pages, or using tools to generate documentation based
on comments in the source code (like javadoc).<br>
<h4>dist</h4>
Create a distribution package for this component. This involves
possibly compiling, document generation and other tasks, and results in
an archive containing the distribution.<br>
<h4>check</h4>
Run all tests, especially unit tests, for the component. This usually
results in a generated test-report.<br>
