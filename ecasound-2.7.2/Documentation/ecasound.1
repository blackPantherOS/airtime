.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing\&. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling\&. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms\&. 
Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their
parameters can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators 
and MIDI-CCs\&. A versatile console mode user-interface is included 
in the package\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP 
Note! All options except those mentioned in \fIecasound options\fP and 
\fIGlobal options\fP, can be used in ecasound chainsetup files (\&.ecs)\&.
.PP 
\fBECASOUND OPTIONS\fP
.IP 
These options are parsed and handled by the ecasound frontend binary and 
are not passed to backend library\&. This means that these options may
not work in other applications that use ecasound libraries for their
functionality\&.
.IP 
.IP "-c"
Starts ecasound in interactive mode\&. In interactive mode you can
control ecasound with simple commands ("start", "stop", "pause",
etc\&.)\&. See ecasound-iam \&.
.IP 
.IP "-C"
Disables ecasound\&'s interactive mode (see \&'-c\&' and \&'-K\&')\&.

.IP 
.IP "-D"
Print all debug information to stderr (unbuffered, plain output
without ncurses)\&.
.IP 
.IP "-s[:]chainsetup-file"
Create a new chainsetup from file \&'chainsetup-file\&' and add
it to the current session\&. Chainsetup files commonly have 
a filename ending to the \&'\&.ecs\&' extension\&. A chainsetup can 
contain inputs, outputs, chains, effects, controllers -- i\&.e\&.
objects one one specific configuration of audio processing
elements\&. A session, on the other hand, is a collection of 
one or more chainsetups\&. Only one of the chainsetups may be
connected (i\&.e\&. it can be run/processed)\&. But it is possible 
to have another chainsetup select (i\&.e\&. can be configured)
while other one is current connteced (i\&.e\&. running)\&. 
.IP 
.IP "-E "cmd1 [[args] ; cmd2 args ; \&.\&.\&. ; cmdN]""
Execute a set of Ecasound Interactive mode (EIAM) commands
at launch\&. These commands are executed immediately after 
ecasound is started\&. If the command line contains sufficient
options to create a valid chainsetup that will be executed,
the launch commands are executed after the other command
line options are parsed, but before the processing engine
is started\&. Note that this command is a feature of 
the ecasound frontend binary and not supported by 
the library backend\&. This means that other clients may
not support the \&'-E\&' option, and also that the launch
commands are not saved as part of chainsetup or session
state\&.
.IP 
.IP "--server"
Enables the so called NetECI mode, in which ecasound can
be controlled remotely over a socket connection\&. When
activated, clients can connect to the running ecasound 
session, and use interactive mode commands to control and
observe ecasound processing\&.
.IP 
The NetECI protocol is defined in 
Ecasound\&'s Programmer Guide
.IP 
One example client using this feature is ecamonitor(1)\&. This
utility is included in the Ecasound distribution package (requires
a working Python environment)\&.
.IP 
\fIWarning!\fP If the machine running ecasound, is connected to 
a public network, be sure to block ecasound\&'s port in your 
firewall! As there is no access control implemented for incoming
connections, anyone can otherwise connect, control and observe your 
ecasound sessions\&.
This option replaces \&'--daemon\&' (deprecated in 2\&.6\&.0)\&.
.IP 
.IP "--server-tcp-port=NNN"
Set the TCP port used by the daemon mode\&. By default
ecasound will use port number \fI2868\fP\&.
This option replaces \&'--daemon-port\&' (deprecated in 2\&.6\&.0)\&.
.IP 
.IP "--no-server"
Disable ecasound\&'s daemon mode\&. This is the default\&.
This option replaces \&'--nodaemon\&' (deprecated in 2\&.6\&.0)\&.
.IP 
.IP "--osc-udp-port=NNN"
Enables support for Open Source Control (OSC)\&. Ecasound will listen
for incoming OSC messages on UDP port NNN\&. Ecasound\&'s OSC interface
is documented at:
<http://ecasound\&.git\&.sourceforge\&.net/git/gitweb\&.cgi?p=ecasound/ecasound;a=blob;f=Documentation/ecasound_osc_interface\&.txt;hb=HEAD>
.IP 
Note that OSC support is still experimental and the interface
might change in later versions of Ecasound\&.
.IP 
This option was added to ecasound 2\&.7\&.0\&.
.IP 
.IP "--keep-running,-K"
Do not exit when processing is finished/stopped\&. Only affects
non-interactive operating mode (see -c/-C)\&.
Option added to ecasound 2\&.4\&.2\&.
.IP 
.IP "--help,-h"
Show this help\&.
.IP 
.IP "--version"
Print version info\&.
.IP 
\fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fP
.PP 
.IP "-d, -dd, -ddd"
Increase the amount of printed debug messages\&. \fI-d\fP adds 
some verbosity, while \fI-ddd\fP results in very detailed 
output\&.
.IP 
.IP "-d:debug_level"
Set the debug level mask to \&'debug_level\&'\&. This a bitmasked value with
the following classes: errors (1), info (2), subsystems (4), module_names (8),
user_objects (16), system_objects 32, functions (64), continuous (128) and
eiam_return_values (256)\&. Default is 271 (1+2+4+8+256)\&. See sourcode 
documentation for the ECA_LOGGER class for more detailed information\&.
.IP 
.IP "-R[:]path-to-file"
Use ecasound resource file (see ecasoundrc man page) \&'path-to-file\&' as 
the only source of setting resource value\&. Specifying this option
will disable the normal policy of querying both global and user (if exists)
resource files\&.
.IP 
.IP "-q"
Quiet mode, no output\&. Same as \fI-d:0\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBGENERAL CHAINSETUP OPTIONS\fP

.IP 
.IP "-a:chainname1, chainname2, \&.\&.\&."
Selects active signal chains\&. All inputs and outputs following
this \&'-a\&' option are assigned to selected chains (until a new -a
option is specified)\&. When adding effects, controllers and other
chain operators, only one chain can be selected at a time\&. If no -a option 
has been given, chain \&'default\&' is used instead when adding objects\&. 
Chain name \&'all\&' is also reserved\&. It will cause all existing chains
to be selected\&. By giving multiple -a options, you can control to which 
chains effects, inputs and outputs are assigned to\&. Look at the \fBEXAMPLES\fP
section for more detailed info about the usage of this option\&.
.IP 
.IP "-n:name"
Sets the name of chainsetup to \&'name\&'\&. If not specified, defaults
either to "command-line-setup" or to the file name from which
chainsetup was loaded\&. Whitespaces are not allowed\&.
.IP 
.IP "-x"
Truncate outputs\&. All output object are opened in overwrite mode\&. 
Any existing files will be truncated\&.
.IP 
.IP "-X"
Open outputs for updating\&. Ecasound opens all outputs - if target
format allows it - in readwrite mode\&.
.IP 
.IP "-z:feature"
Enables \&'feature\&'\&. Most features can be disabled using notation 
\fI-z:nofeature\fP\&. \&'-z:db,dbsize\&' enables double-buffering for audio 
objects that support it (dbsize=0 for default, otherwise buffer
size in sample frames)\&. \&'-z:nodb\&' disables double-buffering\&. 
\&'-z:intbuf\&' and \&'-z:nointbuf\&' control whether extra internal buffering 
is allowed for realtime devices\&. Disabling this can reduce 
latency times in some situations\&. With \&'-z:xruns\&', processing will be 
halted if an under/overrun occurs\&. \&'-z:multitrack\&' and
\&'z:nomultitrack\&' can be used to force ecasound to enable or disable
multitrack-mode\&. In rare cases you may want to explicitly specify 
the recording offset with \&'-z:multitrack,offset-in-samples\&'\&. The
offset is the amount of samples skipped when recording from 
real-time inputs\&. \&'-z:psr\&' enables the \fIprecise-sample-rates\fP mode 
for OSS-devices\&. \&'-z:mixmode,sum\&' enables mixing mode where channels
are mixed by summing all channels\&. The default is \&'-z:mixmode,avg\&',
in which channels are mixed by averaging\&. Mixmode selection was first
added to ecasound 2\&.4\&.0\&.
See ecasoundrc man page\&.
.IP 
\fBCHAINSETUP BUFFERING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIONS\fP

.IP 
.IP "-B:buffering_mode"
Selects the default buffering mode\&. Mode is one of: \&'auto\&' (default),
\&'nonrt\&', \&'rt\&', \&'rtlowlatency\&'\&.
.IP 
.IP "-b:buffer size"
Sets the size of buffer in samples (must be an exponent of 2)\&. This
is quite an important option\&. For real-time processing, you should
set this as low as possible to reduce the processing delay\&. Some
machines can handle buffer values as low as 64 and 128\&. In some
circumstances (for instance when using oscillator envelopes) small
buffer sizes will make envelopes act more smoothly\&. When not processing
in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal files), values between
512 - 4096 often give better results\&. Default is 1024\&.
.IP 
.IP "-r:sched_priority"
Use realtime scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO)\&. This is impossible if 
ecasound doesn\&'t have root priviledges\&. Beware! This gives better 
performance, but can cause total lock-ups if something goes wrong\&.
The \&'sched_priority\&' can be omitted (0=omitted)\&. If given, 
this is the static priority to the highest priority ecasound thread\&.
Other ecasound threads run with priority \&'sched_priority-1\&.\&.\&.n\&'\&.
Value \&'-1\&' can be used to disable raised-priority mode\&.
.IP 
.IP "-z:feature"
Relevant features are -z:db,xxx (-z:nodb) and -z:intbuf (-z:nointbuf)\&.
See section \fIGeneral chainsetup options\fP for details\&.
.IP 
\fBPROCESSING CONTROL\fP
.IP "-t:seconds"
Sets processing time in seconds (doesn\&'t have to be an integer value)\&.
If processing time isn\&'t set, engine stops when all inputs are 
finished\&. This option is equivalent to the \&'cs-set-length\&' EIAM
command\&. A special-case value of \&'-1\&' will set the chainsetup length 
according to the longest input object\&.
.IP 
.IP "-tl"
Enables looping\&. When processing is finished, engine will start 
again from beginning\&. This option is equivalent to the \&'cs-loop\&' 
EIAM command\&.
.IP 
\fBINPUT/OUTPUT SETUP\fP
.PP 
See ecasound user\&'s guide for 
more detailed documentation\&.
.PP 
.IP "-G:mgrtype,optstring"
Sets options for audio object manager type \&'mgrtype\&'\&. 
For available options, see "OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES" below\&.
.IP 
.IP "-f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate,interleaving"
Sets the audio stream parameters for subsequent audio objects\&.
To set different parameters for different audio objects, multiple
\&'-f\&' options have to be specified (note the ordering, the \&'-f\&'
options should precede the audio objects for them to have any
effect)\&. See documentation for \&'-i\&' and \&'-o\&' options\&.
.IP 
When an audio object is opened (e\&.g\&. a file or sound device
is opened, or connection is made to a sound server), the audio
stream parameters are passed to the object\&. It should be noted that
not all audio objects allow to set any or all of the parameters\&.
For instance when opening existing audio files, many file formats 
have a header describing the file audio parameters\&. In 
these cases the audio file header overrides the parameters
passed with \&'-f\&' option\&. Similarly when creating JACK inputs and
outputs, the JACK server mandates the sampling rate and sample
format\&.
.IP 
If no \&'-f\&' option is specified, or some of the argument fields
are left empty (e\&.g\&. \&'-f:,2,44100\&'), ecasound will use default values\&. These 
default values are defined in ecasoundrc configuration file\&. See
ecasoundrc(5) manual page\&. 
.IP 
Note that ecasound opens out files by default in update mode\&. 
Unless option \&'-x\&' (overwrite outputs) option is given, 
audio parameters of an existing audio file take preference over
the params set with \&'-f\&'\&.
.IP 
Sample format is given as a formatted string\&. The first letter is 
either "u", "s" and "f" (unsigned, signed, floating point)\&. The 
following number specifies sample size in bits\&. If sample is 
little endian, "_le" is added to the end\&. Similarly if big endian, 
"_be" is added\&. If endianess is not specified, host byte-order is used\&. 
Currently supported formats are "u8" (same as "8"), "s16_le" (same 
as "16"), "s16_be", "s24_le", "s24_be", "s32_le", "s32_be", "f32_le" 
and "f32_be"\&. An empty string "" picks the system default sample
format\&.
.IP 
The 4th parameter defines the channel layout\&. The available
options are \&'i\&' (interleaved\&' and \&'n\&' (noninterleaved)\&. With 
the noninterleaved setting, ecasound will process samples
one channel at a time, and the blocksize is set with \&'-b\&'\&.
The default setting is \&'i\&'\&.
.IP 
.IP "-y:seconds"
Sets starting position for last specified input/output\&. If 
you need more flexible control over audio objects, you should
use the \fI\&.ewf\fP format\&.
.IP 
.IP "-i[:]input-file-or-device[,params]"
Specifies a new input source that is connected to all selected chains (chains
are selected with \&'-a:\&.\&.\&.\&')\&. Connecting multiple inputs to the same chain is 
not possible, but one input can be connected to multiple chains\&. Input can be 
a a file, device or some other audio object (see below)\&. If the input is 
a file, its type is determined using the file name extension\&. If the object 
name contains any commas, the name must be enclosed in backquotes to avoid 
confusing the parser\&. Currently supported formats are RIFF WAVE files (\&.wav), 
audio-cd tracks (\&.cdr), ecasound EWF files (\&.ewf), RAW audio data (\&.raw) and 
MPEG audio files (\&.mp2,\&.mp3)\&. More audio formats are supported via libaudiofile
and libsndfile libraries (see documentation below)\&. MikMod is also supported (\&.xm, 
\&.mod, \&.s3m, \&.it, etc)\&. MIDI files (\&.mid) are supported using Timidity++\&. 
Similarly Ogg Vorbis (\&.ogg) can be read, and written if ogg123 and vorbize tools
are installed; FLAC files (\&.flac) with flac command-line tools or using
libsndfile; and AAC files (\&.aac/\&.m4a/\&.mp4) with faad2/faac tools\&. Supported 
realtime devices are OSS audio devices (/dev/dsp*), ALSA audio and loopback 
devices and JACK audio subsystem\&. If no inputs are specified, the first 
non-option (doesn\&'t start with \&'-\&') command line argument is considered 
to be an input\&.
.IP 
.IP "-o[:]output-file-or-device[,params]"
Works in the same way as the -i option\&. If no outputs are specified,
the default output device is used (see ~/\&.ecasoundrc)\&. If the object 
name contains any commas, the name must be enclosed in backquotes to 
avoid confusing the parser\&. Note, many object types do not support
output (e\&.g\&. MikMod, MIDI and many others)\&.
.IP 
\fIOBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES\fP
.IP "ALSA devices - \&'alsa\&'"
When using ALSA drivers, instead of a device filename, you need to
use the following option syntax: \fB-i[:]alsa,pcm_device_name\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ALSA direct-hw and plugin access - \&'alsahw\&', \&'alsaplugin\&'"
It\&'s also possible to use a specific card and device combination
using the following notation: \fB-i[:]alsahw,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number\fP\&.
Another option is the ALSA PCM plugin layer\&. It works just like 
the normal ALSA pcm-devices, but with automatic channel count and 
sample format conversions\&. Option syntax is 
\fB-i[:]alsaplugin,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "aRts input/output - \&'arts\&'"
If enabled at compile-time, ecasound supports audio input and 
output using aRts audio server\&. Option syntax is \fB-i:arts\fP,
\fB-o:arts\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "Audio file sequencing - \&'audioloop\&', \&'select\&', \&'playat\&'"
Ecasound provides a set of special audio object types that 
can be used for temporal sequencing of audio files - i\&.e\&. looping,
playing only a select portion of a file, playing file at a spefific
time, and other such operation\&.
.IP 
Looping is possible with \fB-i:audioloop,file\&.ext,params\fP\&. The
file name (or any object type understood by Ecasound) given
as the second parameter is played back continuously looping
back to the beginning when the end of file is reached\&. Any additional
parameters given are passed unaltered to the file object\&.
Parameters 3\&.\&.\&.N are passed as is to the child object (i\&.e\&.
"-i audioloop,foo\&.wav,bar1,bar2" will pass parameters
"bar1,bar2" to the "foo\&.wav" object\&.
.IP 
To select and use only a specific segment of an audio object,
the \fB-i:select,start-time,duration,file\&.ext,params\fP can
be used\&. This will play "duration" of "file\&.ext", starting at 
"start-time"\&. The time values should be given as seconds (e\&.g\&.
"2\&.25", or as samples (e\&.g\&. "25000sa")\&. Parameters 4\&.\&.\&.N are 
passed as is to the child object\&.
.IP 
To play an audio object at a given moment in time, 
the \fB-i:playat,play-at-time,file\&.ext,params\fP can be
used\&. This will play "file\&.ext" after position reaches 
"play-at-time"\&. The time values should be given as seconds (e\&.g\&.
"2\&.25", or as samples (e\&.g\&. "25000sa")\&. Parameters 2\&.\&.\&.N are 
passed as is to the child object\&.
.IP 
.IP "Ecasound Wave Files (EWF) - \&'*\&.ewf\&'"
A special file format that allows to slice and loop full (or segments)
of audio files\&. This format is specific to Ecasound\&.
See ecasound user\&'s guide for more 
detailed information\&.
.IP 
See also audio object types \&'audioloop\&', \&'select\&' and \&'playat\&'\&.
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - Overview"
JACK is a low-latency audio server that can be used to connect
multiple independent audio application to each other\&.
It is different from other audio server efforts in that
it has been designed from the ground up to be suitable for low-latency
professional audio work\&. 
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - \&'jack\&'"
Ecasound provides multiple ways to communicate with JACK 
servers\&. To create a JACK input or output object, one should use \fB-i jack\fP and 
\fB-o jack\fP\&. These create JACK client ports "ecasound:in_N" and 
"ecasound:out_n" respectively (\&'N\&' is replaced by the channel number)\&.
Ecasound automatically creates one JACK port for each channel (number
of channels is set with \fB-f:bits,channels,rate\fP option)\&.
.IP 
It is important to note that by default JACK ports are not connected
anywhere (e\&.g\&. to soundcard input/outputs, or to other apps)\&. One thus
has to connect the ports with an external program (e\&.g\&. "QJackCtl"
or "jack_connect")\&.
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - \&'jack,clientname,portprefix\&'"
\fB"jack,clientname"\fP For simple use scanerios, ecasound provides a way to autoconnect
the ecasound ports\&. This can be done with by giving the peer client
name as the second parameter to the "jack" object, e\&.g\&. \fB-o jack,clientname\fP\&.
As an example, \fB-o jack,system\fP will create an output that is
automatically connected to outputs of the default system soundcard\&.
The client parameter can be omitted, in which case no automatic
connections are made\&.
.IP 
If one needs to change the port prefix (e\&.g\&. "in" in client name 
"ecasound:in_N"), the prefix can be specified as the third parameter to 
"jack" object, e\&.g\&. \fB-o jack,,fxout\fP\&. Also the third parameter can be 
omitted, in which case the default prefixes "in" and "out" are used\&.
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - \&'jack_multi\&'"
A variant of \&'jack\&' object type is \&'jack_multi\&'\&. The full object syntax
is \fBjack_multi,destport1,\&.\&.\&.,destportN\fP\&. When a \&'jack_multi\&' object
is connected to a JACK server, first channel of the object is connected
to JACK port \&'destport1\&', second to \&'destport2\&' and so forth\&. For
instance "-f:32,2,44100 -o jack_multi,foo:in,bar:in"
creates a stereo ecasound output object, with its left and right
channels routed to two difference JACK clients\&. The destination ports
must be active when the ecasound engine is launched, or otherwise 
the connections cannot be established\&. If destination ports are not
specified for all channels, or zero length strings are given, those
ports are not connected at launch by ecasound\&.
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - \&'jack_alsa\&', \&'jack_auto\&', \&'jack_generic\&' (**deprecated since 2\&.6\&.0**)"
Ecasound 2\&.5 and older supported "jack_alsa", "jack_auto" and "jack_generic" object 
types, but these are now replaced by a more generic "jack" interface, and thus are
now deprecated (they work but are no longer documented)\&.
.IP 
.IP "JACK input/outputs - client options"
Additionally global JACK options can be set using 
\fB-G:jack,client_name,operation_mode\fP option\&. \&'client_name\&' 
is the name used when registering ecasound to the JACK system\&. 
If \&'operation_mode\&' is "notransport",  ecasound will ignore 
any transport state changes in the JACK-system; in mode 
"send" it will send all start, stop and position-change events to 
other JACK clients; in mode "recv" ecasound will follow JACK start, 
stop and position-change events; and mode "sendrecv" (the default) 
which is a combination of the two previous modes\&.
.IP 
More details about ecasound\&'s JACK support can be found
from Ecasound User\&'s Guide\&.
.IP 
.IP "Libaudiofile - \&'audiofile\&'"
If libaudiofile support was enabled at compile-time, this
option allows you to force Ecasound to use libaudiofile 
for reading/writing a certain audio file\&. Option syntax 
is \fB-i:audiofile,foobar\&.ext\fP (same for \fB-o\fP)\&.
.IP 
.IP "Libsndfile - \&'sndfile\&'"
If libsndfile support was enabled at compile-time, this
option allows you to force Ecasound to use libsndfile 
for reading/writing a certain audio file\&. Option syntax 
is \fB-i:sndfile,foobar\&.ext[,\&.format-ext]\fP (same for \fB-o\fP)\&.
The optional third parameter "format" can be used to 
override the audio format (for example you can create an
AIFF file with filename "foo\&.wav")\&.
.IP 
.IP "Loop device - \&'loop\&'"
Loop devices make it possible to route (loop back) data between 
chains\&. Option syntax is \fB-[io][:]loop,tag\fP\&. If you add
a loop output with tag \&'1\&', all data written to this output is routed
to any loop input with tag \&'1\&'\&. The tag can be either numerical
(e\&.g\&. \&'-i:loop,1\&') or a string (e\&.g\&. "-i:loop,vocals")\&. Like 
with other input/output objects, you can attach the same loop 
device to multiple chains and this way split/mix the signal\&.
.IP 
Note: this \&'loop\&' device is different from \&'audioloop\&' (latter
added to ecasound v2\&.5\&.0)\&.
.IP 
.IP "Mikmod - \&'mikmod\&'"
If mikmod support was enabled at compile-time, this
option allows you to force Ecasound to use Mikmod 
for reading/writing a certain module file\&. Option syntax 
is \fB-i:mikmod,foobar\&.ext\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "Null inputs/outputs - \&'null\&'"
If you specify "null" or "/dev/null" as the input or output, 
a null audio device is created\&. This is useful if you just want
to analyze sample data without writing it to a file\&. There\&'s 
also a realtime variant, "rtnull", which behaves just like "null" 
objects, except all i/o is done at realtime speed\&.
.IP 
.IP "Resample - \&'resample\&'"
Object type \&'resample\&' can be used to resample audio 
object\&'s audio data to match the sampling rate used
in the active chainsetup\&. For example, 
\fBecasound -f:16,2,44100 -i resample,22050,foo\&.wav -o /dev/dsp\fP,
will resample file from 22\&.05kHz to 44\&.1kHz and write the
result to the soundcard device\&. Child sampling rate can be 
replaced with keyword \&'auto\&'\&. In this case ecasound will try 
to query the child object for its sampling rate\&. This works with 
files formats such as \&.wav which store meta information about 
the audio file format\&. To use \&'auto\&' in the previous example, 
\fBecasound -f:16,2,44100 -i resample,auto,foo\&.wav -o /dev/dsp\fP\&.
.IP 
Parameters 4\&.\&.\&.N are passed as is to the child object (i\&.e\&.
"-i resample,22050,foo\&.wav,bar1,bar2" will pass parameters
"bar1,bar2" to the "foo\&.wav" object\&.
.IP 
If ecasound was compiled with support for libsamplerate, you can 
use \&'resample-hq\&' to use the highest quality resampling algorithm 
available\&. To force ecasound to use the internal resampler, 
\&'resampler-lq\&' (low-quality) can be used\&.
.IP 
.IP "Reverse - \&'reverse\&'"
Object type \&'reverse\&' can be used to reverse audio 
data coming from an audio object\&. As an example, 
\fBecasound -i reverse,foo\&.wav -o /dev/dsp\fP will play 
\&'foo\&.wav\&' backwards\&. Reversing output objects is not 
supported\&. Note! Trying to reverse audio object types with really 
slow seek operation (like mp3), works extremely badly\&.
Try converting to an uncompressed format (wav or raw)
first, and then do reversation\&.
.IP 
Parameters 3\&.\&.\&.N are passed as is to the child object (i\&.e\&.
"-i reverse,foo\&.wav,bar1,bar2" will pass parameters
"bar1,bar2" to the "foo\&.wav" object\&.
.IP 
.IP "System standard streams and named pipes - \&'stdin\&', \&'stdout\&'"
You can use standard streams (stdin and stdout) by giving \fBstdin\fP
or \fBstdout\fP as the file name\&. Audio data is assumed to be in
raw/headerless (\&.raw) format\&. If you want to use named pipes,

.IP "Tone generator - \&'tone\&'"
To generate a test tone, input \fB-i:tone,type,freq,duration-secs\fP 
can be used\&. Parameter \&'type\&' specifies the tone type: currently
only \&'sine\&' is supported\&. The \&'freq\&' parameter sets the frequency 
of the generated tone and \&'duration-secs\&' the length of the generated

produce an infinite stream\&. This feature was first added to Ecasound 
2\&.4\&.7\&.
.IP 
.IP "Typeselect - \&'typeselect\&'"
The special \&'typeselect\&' object type can be used to override 
how ecasound maps filename extensions and object types\&. For 
instance \fBecasound -i typeselect,\&.mp3,an_mp3_file\&.wav -o /dev/dsp\fP\&.
would play the file \&'an_mp3_file\&.wav\&' as an mp3-file and not
as an wav-file as would happen without typeselect\&.

.IP 
.IP "-ea:amplify%"
Adjusts the signal amplitude to \&'amplify%\&' percent (linear scale, i\&.e\&. 
individual samples are multiplied by \&'amplify%/100\&')\&. See also

.IP 
.IP "-eac:amplify%,channel"
Amplifies signal of channel \&'channel\&' by amplify-% percent (linear

\&'channel\&' ranges from 1\&.\&.\&.n where n is the total number of channels\&. 
See also \&'-eadb\&'\&.
.IP 
.IP "-eadb:gain-dB[,channel]"
Adjusts signal level by \&'gain-dB\&', with a gain of 0dB having no effect
to the signal, negative gains attenuating the signal and positive
gain values amplifying it\&. The \&'channel\&' parameter (1\&.\&.\&.n) is optional\&. 
If \&'channel\&' parameter is specified, and its value is nonzero, gain is 
only applied to the given channel (1\&.\&.\&.n)\&.
.IP

Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent (linear scale, i\&.e\&. individual

clipped samples (resulting sample value is outside the nominal 
[-1,1] range), a warning will be issued\&.

Limiter effect\&. Limits audio level to \&'limit-%\&' (linear scale) with
values equal or greater than 100% resulting in no change to

.IP 
.IP "-ec:rate,threshold-%"
Compressor (a simple one)\&. \&'rate\&' is the compression rate in
decibels (\&'rate\&' dB change in input signal causes 1dB change

1\&.0 (max amplitude)\&.
.IP 
.IP "-eca:peak-level-%, release-time-sec, fast-crate, crate"
A more advanced compressor (original algorithm by John S\&. Dyson)\&. 
If you give a value of 0 to any parameter, the default is used\&.
\&'peak-level-%\&' essentially specifies how hard the peak limiter
is pushed\&.  The default of 69% is good\&. \&'release_time\&' is given 
in seconds\&. This compressor is very sophisticated, and actually
the release time is complex\&.  This is one of the dominant release 
time controls, but the actual release time is dependent on a lot of 
factors regarding the dynamics of the audio in\&. \&'fastrate\&' is the 
compression ratio for the fast compressor\&.  This is not really 
the compression ratio\&.  Value of 1\&.0 is infinity to one, while the 
default 0\&.50 is 2:1\&.  Another really good value is special cased in 
the code: 0\&.25 is somewhat less than 2:1, and sounds super smooth\&.
\&'rate\&' is the compression ratio for the entire compressor chain\&.  
The default is 1\&.0, and holds the volume very constant without many nasty
side effects\&.  However the dynamics in music are severely restricted,
and a value of 0\&.5 might keep the music more intact\&.
.IP 
.IP "-enm:threshold-level-%,pre-hold-time-msec,attack-time-msec,post-hold-time-msec,release-time-msec"
Noise gate\&. Supports multichannel processing (each channel 
processed separately)\&. When signal amplitude falls below
\&'threshold_level_%\&' percent (100% means maximum amplitude), gate 
is activated\&. If the signal stays below the threshold for 
\&'th_time\&' ms, it\&'s faded out during the attack phase of 
\&'attack\&' ms\&. If the signal raises above the \&'threshold_level\&' 
and stays there over \&'hold\&' ms the gate is released during 
\&'release\&' ms\&.

Pitch shifter\&. Modifies audio pitch by altering its length\&.
.IP 
.IP "-epp:right-%"
Stereo panner\&. Changes the relative balance between the first

signal is mixed to the original\&. \&'feedback-%\&' represents how much of
the signal is recycled in each delay or, if you prefer, at what rate
the repeated snippet of delayed audio fades\&. Note that sufficiently
low feedback values may result in a number of audible repetitions
lesser than what you have specified for \&'number_of_delays\&', especially

.IP 
.IP "-ge:open-threshold-%,close-thold-%,volume-mode,reopen-count"
Threshold gate\&. Initially gate is closed\&. It is opened when volume
goes over \&'othreshold\&' percent\&. After this, if volume drops below
\&'cthold\&' percent, gate is closed and won\&'t be opened again, unless the
\&'reopen-count\&' is set to anything other than zero\&.
If \&'value_mode\&' is \&'rms\&', average RMS volume is used\&. Otherwise
peak average is used\&.  When closed, passing audio buffers are trucated
to zero length\&.
If the \&'reopen-count\&' is set to a positive number, then the gate will 
restart its operation that many times\&. So for example, a reopen count 
of 1 will cause up to 2 openings of the gate\&. A negative value for \&'reopen-count\&'
will result in the gate reopening indefinitely\&. The \&'reopen-count\&' is invaluable 
in recording vinyl and tapes, where you can set things up and then recording 
starts whenever the needle is on the vinyl, and stops when it\&'s off\&. As many sides

.PP 
When ecasound receives any of the POSIX signals SIGINT (ctrl-c), 
SIGHUP, SIGTERM or SIGQUIT, normal cleanup and exit procedure is 
initiated\&. Here normal exit means that e\&.g\&. file headers are 
updated before closing, helper processes are terminated in normal 
way, and so forth\&.
.PP 
If, while doing the cleanup described above, ecasound receives
another signal (of the same set of POSIX signals), ecasound
will skip the normal cleanup procedure, and terminate
immediately\&. Any remaining cleanup tasks will be skipped\&. 
Depending on the runtime state and configuration, this brute 
force exit may have some side-effects\&. Ecasound will return
exit code of \&'4\&' if normal cleanup was skipped\&.
.PP 
Special case handling is applied to the SIGINT (ctrl-c) signal\&.
If a SIGINT signal is received during the cleanup procedure,
ecasound will ignore the signal once, and emit a notice to \&'stderr\&'
