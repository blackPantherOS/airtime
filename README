Airtime is an open source application that provides remote automation 
of a radio station.

Major features:
 * Web-based remote station management.  Authorized personnel can add
   program material, create playlists, and schedule programming all via 
   a web interface.
 * Automation.  Airtime has a scheduler function that enables users to
   set playlists for playback at a date and time of their choosing.
   Playlists can be played back multiple times.
 * Playlists.  Airtime allows users to create playlists that can be 
   either played on-demand in the Studio or in automated mode.  Playlists
   can be nested inside each other, so for example, a playlist with a 
   block of ads can be inside of a playlist with a music program.
 * Centralized archives of station program material.  Station personnel
   have a searchable, browseable central archive that is accessible both
   in the office and via the web.
 * Solid, fast playback.  Airtime uses the open source Liquidsoap 
   multimedia framework for clean, reliable, fast playback. 
 * Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
   all parts of the program code.
