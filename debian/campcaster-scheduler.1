.B campcaster-scheduler
.RI start|stop|restart|status|install|uninstall|kill
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the daemon behind the campcaster-radio-system which is usually launched
during boot with administrator privileges. However this tool is also used to
query the current status of the server or perform administrative tasks.

XML-RPC interface for the Scheduler, which can be accessed via web/HTML
interface or via the campcaster-studio GUI.

Campcaster is the first free and open radio management software, providing
live studio broadcast capabilities as well as the remote automation in one
integrated system. The scalability of Campcaster allows implementation in a
number of use scenarios, ranging from an unmanned broadcast unit accessed from
remote through the Internet to a local network of Campcaster machines inside a
radio station handling live broadcasts and delivering program automation by
accessing a central audio storage system. Campcaster is capable of combining
local audio files and remote web streams, supporting the widely used MP3 format
and the open equivalent OGG Vorbis.
