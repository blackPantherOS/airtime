.SH NAME
campcaster-import \- batch upload files to Campcaster storage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B campcaster-import
.RI "[-h] -l|-c" " FILES_OR_DIRS"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool enables users to batch upload audio files to the Campcaster storage server.
There are two ways to import audio files into Campcaster: linking or copying.
You need to specify how to import the files by using either 
.B \-l
(link) or 
.B -c
(copy) option. 
.B -h 
will print further help information.
.PP
Linking has the advantage that it will not duplicate any files,
but you must take care not to move, rename, or delete any of the
imported files from their current locations on disk.
.PP
Copying has the advantage that you can do whatever you like with
the source files after you import them, but has the disadvantage
that it requires double the disk space needed to store your files.
.PP
Campcaster is free and open radio management software, providing
live studio broadcast capabilities as well as the remote automation in one
integrated system. The scalability of Campcaster allows implementation in a
number of use scenarios, ranging from an unmanned broadcast unit accessed from 
via the Internet to a local network of Campcaster machines inside a
radio station handling live broadcasts and delivering program automation by
accessing a central audio storage system. Campcaster is capable of combining
local audio files and remote web streams, supporting the widely used MP3 format
and the open equivalent OGG Vorbis.
