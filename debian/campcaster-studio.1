.SH NAME
campcaster-studio \- native interface for Campcaster
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B campcaster-studio
.SH DESCRIPTION
campcaster-studio is a desktop application which connects to the
Campcaster server and enables you to broadcast live shows or schedule automated
playback.
.PP
Campcaster Studio is mainly targeted at doing live shows, though it is possible
to do automated scheduling through this interface as well. Note that Campcaster Web
has a much more robust interface for handling automated scheduling.
.PP
Campcaster is free and open radio management software, providing
live studio broadcast capabilities as well as the remote automation in one
integrated system. The scalability of Campcaster allows implementation in a
number of use scenarios, ranging from an unmanned broadcast unit accessed via 
the Internet to a local network of Campcaster machines inside a
radio station handling live broadcasts and delivering program automation by
accessing a central audio storage system. Campcaster is capable of combining
local audio files and remote web streams, supporting the widely used MP3 format
and the open equivalent OGG Vorbis.
