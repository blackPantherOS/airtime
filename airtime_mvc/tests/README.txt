To get the Airtime unit tests running:
==========================

1) Install PHPUnit and DbUnit

We explicitly install PHPUnit 3.4 because that's as a new of a version
as is supported by Zend Framework 1:

sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
sudo pear channel-discover pear.symfony.com
sudo pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
sudo pear install channel://pear.symfony-project.com/YAML
sudo pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit-3.4.15
sudo pear install pear.phpunit.de/DbUnit-1.0.3
