# We attempt to document a list of all special cases and hacks that the
# following classes should be able to handle.
# TODO : implement all of the following special cases
#
# - Recursive directories being added to organized dirs are not handled
# properly as they only send a request for the dir and not for every file. Also
# more hacks are needed to check that the directory finished moving/copying?
#
# - In the case when a 'watched' directory's subdirectory is delete we should
# send a special request telling ApiController to delete a whole dir. This is
# done becasue pyinotify will not send an individual file delete event for
# every file in that directory
#
# - Special move events are required whenever a file is moved from a 'watched'
# directory into another 'watched' directory (or subdirectory). In this case we
# must identify the file by its md5 signature instead of it's filepath like we
# usually do. Maybe it's best to always identify a file based on its md5
# signature?. Of course that's not possible for some modification events
# because the md5 signature will change...

# Note: Because of the way classes that inherit from pyinotify.ProcessEvent
# interact with constructors. you should only instantiate objects from them
# using keyword arguments. For example:
# OrganizeListener('watch_signal') <= wrong
# OrganizeListener(signal='watch_signal') <= right

# This could easily be a module
