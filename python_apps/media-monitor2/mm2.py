# 1. Initialize logging
# 2. Create MMConfig from the config file
# 3. Configure the locale
# 4. Initialize all event handlers (WatchManager, OrganizeListener, etc.)
# 5. Get bootstrap db from airtime
# 6. Sync the db according to the filesystem (and vice versa in some cases)
# 7. Initialize listeners for watched and organize directories
# 8. Initialize kombu listener for receiving messages from airtime
# 9. Start the toucher thread that updates the last modified time of the index
#    file as the program is running
