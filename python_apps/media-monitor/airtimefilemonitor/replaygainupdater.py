    The purpose of the class is to query the server for a list of files which do not have a ReplayGain
    value calculated. This class will iterate over the list calculate the values, update the server and 
    repeat the process until the the server reports there are no files left.
    
    This class will see heavy activity right after a 2.1->2.2 upgrade since 2.2 introduces ReplayGain 
    normalization. A fresh install of Airtime 2.2 will see this class not used at all since a file
    imported in 2.2 will automatically have its ReplayGain value calculated.
