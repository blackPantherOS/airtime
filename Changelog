1.8.0 - April 19, 2011
  * The biggest feature of this release is the ability to edit shows. You can
    change everything from ‘Name’, ‘Description’, and ‘URL’, to repeat and 
    rebroadcast days. Show instances will be dynamically created or removed as
    needed.  Radio stations will be pleased to know they can now have up to 
    ten rebroadcast shows too.
  * Airtime’s calendar now looks, feels and performs better than ever. Loading
    a station schedule is now five to eight times faster. In our tests of 1.7, 
    if the month calendar had shows scheduled for every hour of every day, it 
    used to take 16 seconds to load. Now in 1.8 it takes two seconds.
  * It is possible to have up to ten rebroadcast shows now, in 1.7 it was only
    up to five.
  * Airtime’s new installation script has two options for increased install 
    flexibility:  --preserve to keep your existing config files, or --overwrite 
    to replace your existing config files with new ones. Uninstall no longer 
    removes Airtime config files or the music storage directory.
  * New improved look & feel of the calendar (thanks to the "FullCalendar" 
    jQuery project).
  * Installation now puts files in standard locations in the Linux file 
    hierarchy, which prepares the project to be accepted into Ubuntu and Debian.
    Also because of our wish to be part of those projects, the default output 
    stream type is now OGG instead of MP3 -- due to MP3 licensing issues. 
    This configuration can be changed in "/etc/airtime/liquidsoap.conf".
  * You now have the ability to start and stop pypo and the show recorder from 
    the command line with the commands "airtime-pypo-start", 
    "airtime-pypo-stop", "airtime-show-recorder-start", and 
    "airtime-show-recorder-stop".
  * Bug fixes:
    * CC-2192 Schedule sent to pypo is not sorted by start time.
    * CC-2175 Overbooking: Cut off shows when they are done
    * CC-2174 Need formatting and a warning icon for the message for overbooking a show
    * CC-2039 Upload file: file name cropped
    * CC-2177 Schedule editing does not work under Firefox 4

    o Recording/rebroadcast status of a show is shown in "Now Playing" and "Calendar"
    o Can rebroadcast a show at multiple times and dates
  * Automatic upload of recorded shows to Soundcloud
  * Frontend JQuery widgets for public-facing websites to show your visitors what's playing and the upcoming schedule.

    o In version 1.6, you had to make sure that your show was ready to go 30 seconds before it started.
  * Upgrade support (should be able to upgrade from any version, unlike 1.6.1 which required an uninstall of 1.6.0 first)
  * "Now Playing" list view:
     o audio items are now grouped by show.

     o Audio items that play past the show's end time have a visual notification that they will be cut off
  * Ability to change metadata tag display format for web streams
  * Config files moved to /etc/airtime.  This means all config files are in one convenient location and separated from the code, so you can upgrade your code independently of your config files.
